# `005` Array Memory Size

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Find the memory size of the array `vector` and print it in the console.

## Expected Output:

```bash
80
```

## 💡Hints:

+ If you want to get the memory size of an element you can use the property `itemsize`.

+ If you want to get the number of elements in the array, you can use the property: `size`.

+ The memory size of an array is the sum of all the elements' memory size. In this case, all the elements are null (All of them have the same value), then you can multiply the number of elements by the memory size of the element in order to get the memory size of the array.
