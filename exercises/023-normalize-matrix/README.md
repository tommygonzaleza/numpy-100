## 💡 Hints:

+ To normalize something means to scale a vector to make it a unit vector. For a vector in a finite dimensional space, this just means divide each component by the length of the vector.

+ You have to use the `std` function. You can learn more about this function on the following link: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.std.html.

+ You should also use the `mean` function. You can learn more about this function on the following link: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.mean.html.
