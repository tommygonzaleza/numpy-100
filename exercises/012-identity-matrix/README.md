# `012` Identity Matrix

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Create an identity matrix of dimensions 3 x 3 and print it in the console.

## Expected Output:

```bash
[[1. 0. 0.]
 [0. 1. 0.]
 [0. 0. 1.]]
```

## 💡 Hints:

+ The identity matrix is a matrix with ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere.

+ The `eye()` function creates an idenity matrix. You can read more about this function here: https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.eye.html.
