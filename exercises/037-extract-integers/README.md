# `037` Extract Integers

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Extract the integer part of the numbers of the given vector.

2. Print the vector without the decimals.

## 💡 Hint:

+ You can use four different methods to get the integer part of a float number. You can use numpy's functions `np.floor` or `np.trunc`. On the other side, you can use other methods like: `vector // 1` or `vector.astype(int)`. On this case, you should use a numpy method.
