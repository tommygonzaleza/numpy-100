# `020` Checkerboard Pattern

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Create an 8 x 8 matrix and fill it with a checkerboard pattern.

2. Print the matrix in the console.

## Expected Output:

```bash
[[0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1]
 [1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0]
 [0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1]
 [1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0]
 [0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1]
 [1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0]
 [0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1]
 [1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0]]
```

## 💡 Hint:

+ You have to modify the matrix with array indexing, e.g.: `array[::2]`.
